In December 2019, COVID-19 coronavirus was first identified in the Wuhan region of China. By March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) categorized the COVID-19 outbreak as a pandemic. In this project try to see some of the data of cases worldwide and see the impact of factors likw GDP per capita and and GPI index on the number of cases and fatality rate. 
GDP: Per capita gross domestic product (GDP) is a metric that breaks down a country's economic output per person and is calculated by dividing the GDP of a country by its population. Per capita GDP is a global measure for gauging the prosperity of nations and is used by economists, along with GDP, to analyze the prosperity of a country based on its economic growth. Small, rich countries and more developed industrial countries tend to have the highest per capita GDP. 
Global Peace Index (GPI) is a report produced by the Institute for Economics & Peace (IEP) which measures the relative position of nations' and regions' peacefulness. The GPI ranks 172 independent states and territories (99.7 per cent of the world's population) according to their levels of peacefulness.
