#Visualising Worldwine New Covid Cases

#In the COVID dataframe each country's data has been collected over a period of 318 days from 3rd Jan 2020.The y-axis in that plot indicates that the total number of confirmed cases around the world approaching 200,000. We see that there is an odd jump in mid February, then the rate of new cases slows down for a while, then speeds up again in March.Then we see that there has been an exponential rise in the number of cases worldwide per day from Mid October to November.

#Impact of GDP on Fatality

#GDP: Per capita gross domestic product (GDP) is a metric that breaks down a country's economic output per person and is calculated by dividing the GDP of a country by its population. Per capita GDP is a global measure for gauging the prosperity of nations and is used by economists, along with GDP, to analyze the prosperity of a country based on its economic growth. Small, rich countries and more developed industrial countries tend to have the highest per capita GDP.

#In Sudan the number of cases peaked during May-July after which it steadily decreased in Octobor and is again on the rise in November. We see a small bump in the number of deaths in the period where number of new COVID cases was increasing increasing, with a steep rise in the number of deaths in November which is quite alarming.



#Impact of the Global Peace Index on Fatality

#Global Peace Index (GPI) is a report produced by the Institute for Economics & Peace (IEP) which measures the relative position of nations' and regions' peacefulness. The GPI ranks 172 independent states and territories (99.7 per cent of the world's population) according to their levels of peacefulness. The GPI data indicates Iceland, Denmark, New Zealand to be the most peaceful countries, and Somalia, Afghanistan, Sudan to be the least peaceful.

#The top 5 countries with the highest fatality rate and high GPI score  due to COVID are Yemen, Mexico, Sudan, Chad in the decreasing order of fatality rate. Interestingly these countries also fall into categories of countries with the lowest GDP.

#Countries with GDP per capita less than 10000 were definitely has a spike in COVID cases. However we see a huge spike in total number of cases with a with GDP per capita greater than 40000. We try to find out these countries with the largest spikes in total number of COVID Cases
